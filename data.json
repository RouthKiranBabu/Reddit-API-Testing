There was that bhumi Pednekar movie where they made her really dark, instead of getting a dark skinned person to play the role. It's almost as if they're so against dark skin that they won't even give them opportunities. Stop defending this ffs",

Anywhere we go, people will come up and ask to take pictures with her, when we say no they often get aggressive and abusive then proceed to take pictures of her without consent. I have to act like a 24/7 security detail when I'm out and about with her. \n \nThis has happened to us at India gate, war memorial, museums, while waiting for a table at restaurants, on the shatabdi express, at humayuns tomb, and these are the incidents I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nIt's embarrassing and saddens me because these experiences make my wife not want to come to India. As for a fix there isn't one. Even my parents brush these incidents off by saying, people are just excited by the novelty of seeing a white person and we should not take it to heart."
