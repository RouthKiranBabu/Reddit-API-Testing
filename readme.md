# Cypress Automation and Postman API testing

## Introduction
### Cypress
Cypress is a powerful, modern front-end testing tool built specifically for web applications. It allows developers and testers to write automated tests to ensure the functionality, reliability, and performance of web apps. What sets Cypress apart from other testing frameworks is its ability to work directly with the browser, providing a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use testing environment.
### Postman API Testing
Postman is a powerful API testing tool that simplifies the process of developing, testing, and debugging APIs. It provides an intuitive user interface for creating and sending HTTP requests, inspecting responses, and automating API workflows.

## Features
### Key Features of Cypress
- `Real-time Reloads`: Automatically reloads tests on changes, offering instant feedback.
- `Automatic Waiting`: It waits for DOM elements to load, eliminating the need for manual wait commands.
- `Time Travel`: You can visually see each step of the test execution with a snapshot for easy debugging.
- `Built-in Assertions`: Provides built-in assertions that validate the behavior of your application during the test run.
- `Headless Browser Testing`: Supports running tests without a graphical interface using headless browsers.
- `Easy Setup`: Cypress doesnâ€™t require complex setup or additional configurations. You just install the tool and can start writing tests.
Cypress is typically used for end-to-end testing, but it also supports integration and unit testing. It is particularly popular for testing JavaScript-based applications, but it works well with other tech stacks too.

### Key Features of Postman
  - `User-Friendly Interface`: Allows users to easily construct and send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
  - `Request Customization`: Supports adding headers, query parameters, authorization, and body data (JSON, XML, etc.).
  - `Response Validation`: Displays server responses, including status codes, headers, and body, for debugging and validation.
  - `Automation with Collections`: Group related API requests into Collections for reusability and sharing.
  - `Environment Management`: Define variables and environments for dynamic testing (e.g., development, staging, production).
  - `Scripting`: Use JavaScript for pre-request scripts and test scripts to add logic for request execution and response validation.
  - `Integration`: Supports integrations with CI/CD pipelines, version control systems, and other tools like Newman for command-line execution.
  - `Collaboration`: Enables teams to collaborate on API testing and documentation in real-time.

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
  1. Made different folders for each Sections:
     - `Cypress` - For Automation testing.
     - `Praw Module in Python` - To get JSON data.
     - `Postman API Testing` - For requests and response communication using JSON file.

## Installation & Getting started
  - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### Commands
#### To install JSON Server
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```
#### To run JSON Server
```bash
json-server jsonFile
```
#### Git Commands
```bash
1. How to connect the folder to the GitHub repository.
cd EnterWorkingDirectory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/RouthKiranBabu/testrepo.git
https://github.com/RouthKiranBabu/testReddit.git
git branch
git branch day_1
git checkout day_1
git push -u origin day_1
git push -u origin master
git pull --rebase origin master
git commit -m "First Commit"
git push -u origin master
git status
git reflog
// refresh the page

cd "Project folder path"
git status

// to check what branch we are in
git branch

// to create a new branch
git branch branchName

// to check all the branch
git branch

// to move to the desired branch
git checkout branchName
git branch

// to create a file
touch login.java
git status

git add .
git status
git commit -m "branch demo"
git status
git push -u origin login

// moving to the other branch also changes files and folders
git checkout main

git status

// when you are in the main branch to merge
// then whatever files and folder is present in the 
git merge login

git push -u origin main
git branch -d login

// to delete the branch
git push origin --delete login

Eg:
cd OneDrive
cd Desktop
cd projectFolder
git status
git add .
git commit -m "added Initial cypress look."
git push -u origin day_1

Eg:
cd OneDrive
cd Desktop
cd projectFolder
git branch day_2
git checkout day_2
git status
git add .
git status
git commit -m "added Second days work."
git push -u origin day_2

```

# ðŸ‘‰Code Section
  ## Aim
  - Design, Implement and test the Reddit Social Media.
  ## Things Required
  - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  ## Procedure
  1. Next Day is the dead line need to complete as much as possible as per documentation.
  2. Set High and Low Priority Work.
  3. Do the High Priority Work first and then low priority.
  ## Theory
  - Cypress Commands:
      - [x] `cy.visit()`: Navigates to a URL.
      - [x] `cy.xpath()`: Finds elements on the page).
      - [x] `cy.contains()`: Finds an element containing specific text.
      - [x] `cy.click()`: Simulates a click on an element.
      - [ ] `cy.type()`: Types text into an input field.
      - [ ] `cy.url()`: Asserts the current URL.
      - [x] `cy.should()`: Adds an assertion to verify that something should happen (e.g., an element is visible, contains text, etc.).
      - [x] `cy.log()`: in Cypress is used to output custom messages to the test runnerâ€™s command log, useful for debugging purposes.
      - [x] `cy.screenshot()`: command in Cypress captures a screenshot during tests, useful for debugging and visual test validation.
      - [x] `cy.wait()`: Cypress is used to pause test execution for a specified time or until an alias resolves, improving synchronization.
