  ## Aim
  - Get data from Reddit, Create JSON data and Store in .json file.
  - Make a API from json file to do API testing Using Postman.
  ## Things Required
  - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)
  - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
  ## Procedure
  1. Make a python code which takes data from reddit.
  2. Add code convert into JSON data and save it in .json file.
  3. Make use of json file to create API.
  ## Theory
  ### CheckList
  - `Python Module`/`Commands`/`Applications` Used
      - [x] `praw`: Used to access data from reddit.
      - [x] `json`: Converting normal data into the json and then saving it in .json file.
      - [x] `json-server`: To make the json file to run as API.
      - [x] `json-server jsonFileName`: Command to make API.
      - [ ] `Postman`: Still Not used.
  ### Commands Used
  #### JSON server
  ```bash
  npm install -g json-server
  json-server JsonfileName
  ```
  #### Python Code
  ```python
  import praw
